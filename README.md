# Pokemon Web

This project is in charge of storing the pokeballs and pokemons of the following generations, to inform and to be able to raise awareness among the people who are looking for this information. From our form we explicitly ask for information about the pokemons that you want us to add, and all the pokeballs are added up to the last generation with their respective data.
